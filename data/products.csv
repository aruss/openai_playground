DHC drylin roller bearing configurator,https://drylin-motor-expert.igus.tools/,,"igus offers linear systems that consist of guide rails and bearings that travel on these rails. There are different linear guide system series available. The series drylin W allows the use of roller bearings also referred to as hybrid roller bearings. These bearings are equipped self lubricating gliding elements made from igldur materials in combination with a roller component. The roller component drastically reduces friction and thus allows a very light manual operation with very low required drive force. The drylin W roller bearings are not suited for mechanical or motoric drives. Movement by hand is the purpose for application of roller bearings for example for sliding doors for compartments or machines, adjustable control panels that can be moved to different locations on a rail, machine parts that can be moved manually for example to do maintenance, or other linear movements of objects that should be easily performed by hand. A linear system with roller bearings consists of two rails or one double rail and four roller bearings. 2 bearings on one rail and two on the other rail forming a rectangle. The bearings are connected through a plate, table or similar construction. Together with the connecting plate or table the system is called a complete carriage. There are different designs of drylin roller bearings with one or two rollers build in and with different mounting angles of the rollers inside the bearing. Depending on the application it should work in special combinations of bearings and guide rails are required and special layouts of rails and bearing mounting angels are required. The best suited layout and the suitability of the products itself depend on the mass that should be moved, center of mass offset, carriage length, carriage width, rail distance, system orientation (horizontal or lateral) and the drive point offset. The roller component of a roller bearing can be equipped with a roller that spins on a simple axis or it can be a roller equipped with a ball bearing for even less friction. Roller bearings have a limited lifetime of maximum 200 km. For longer lifetimes and installations with mechanical or electric drive and or high loads pure gliding bearings without rollers from drylin W, drylin T, drylin R, drylin N or drlin T should be considered, that are not part of this configurator. It is important to understand, that roller bearings are suited for systems that are are manually operated, driven, or otherwise moved."
DGE drylin lead screw drive expert,https://drylin-leadscrew-drives-expert.igus.tools,,"dryspin high helix thread product range offers a wide range of different lead screw nuts and lead screw models in various dimensions. The range of dryspin® high helix threads includes diameters from 4 to 20mm and pitches from 2.4 to 100mm. Due to the diversity of the product range, the dryspin thread geometry is conceivable in almost all applications. lead screw drives can replace conventional ball screw drives. It is necessary to adhere to the application parameters (axial load, rotation speed, etc.) and reach the required positioning accuracy. Our lead screw drive expert offers optimal help  for choosing the perfect lead screw system for every application.  advantages of dryspin technology compared to conventional lead screw drives: Higher efficiencies, Quiet and low-vibration operation, 30% longer service life due to asymmetry, Up to 25% less wear, Higher efficiency. Our drylin lead screw nuts are up to 50.9% more cost-effective than metal lead screw nuts. Also up to 69% more cost-effective compared to comparable plastic lead screw nuts and up to 50% more cost-effective compared to ball screw systems. Self-locking means that lead screw nuts and lead screws cannot be moved without the application of external force. It has to do with the pitch and coefficient of friction. Lead screw nuts that are made of tribologically optimised iglidur® materials can be used in temperature ranges between -20°C and +150°C. Our lead screw support blocks are available in thread sizes of 6-24mm. Choice of mounting: plain bearings or, with higher dynamics, ball bearings (BB). All lead screw support blocks, like the matching lead screw clamp rings, are supplied in hard anodised aluminium. In addition to the correct choice of material for the lead screw nut, a preload mechanism against unwanted bearing clearance has proven to be an effective measure in practice. For trapezoidal threads and dryspin® high helix threads, anti backlash, zero backlash & low clearance versions with preload of the thread nut are available. It is no secret that igus is an advocate of non-lubrication of bearings. Simply put, lubrication is not required for igus products. We often hear from customers the recurring question: “Can I use WD-40 or another lubricant to lubricate my bearing? ” The special type of the JGRM threaded nut, in combination with a stainless steel plate, allows the accommodation of static loads of up to 6 MPa. The most important thing to remember when installing a polymer flange lead screw nut is not to exceed the maximum tightening torque of 2.5Nm.  It is also recommended to secure the fastening screws with a third medium, e.g. a semi permanent thread locking glue. When installing a cylindrical lead screw nut made of polymeric, axial and radial locking is necessary. An option for radial locking is the use of set screws. Axial fastening through a sheet metal ring possible. In addition to the correct choice of material, a preloading mechanism has proven to be an effective measure to reduce unwanted axial clearance. For our dryspin® high helix threads and trapezoidal threads there are three versions with preload: Zero-Backlash, Low-Clearance and AB lead screw nut. Here you will find all the advantages and assembly instructions for our clearance-reduced lead screw nuts. Single-start lead screws consist of only one thread. This means that the distance between the flanks, marked by pitch, is also the linear travel (lead) in millimeters per revolution of the lead screw. If another thread is added, the lead screw reaches twice the stroke (2x pitch) with one revolution. The calculation for the linear travel always remains the same depending on the number of threads, only the pitch of a single thread differs. This procedure can also be applied to our multi-start dryspin® high helix lead. Our lead screw nuts are available in 6 different materials: iglidur® J, iglidur® 350, iglidur® R, iglidur® A180, iglidur® J200, iglidur® E7 and iglidur® W300. The differences and advantages of the individual materials can be found here:  iglidur® J, iglidur® W300, iglidur® A180, iglidur® J350, iglidur® E7, iglidur® J200, iglidur® R. Apart from the pitch accuracy of 0.1 to 300mm, customer-specific tolerances are implemented in the end machining of the lead screws and the machining of nuts. According to DIN 103, tolerance class 7e."
